## Description

WASM aims to run everything including C, Go, Java, Kotlin, and Rust, directly on the web. With release of WASI, this capability has expanded, enabling us to run these languages everywhere. Enabling us to deploy the same module on the web, backend, serverless, and IoT devices, all at once.

Inspired on the homonymous movie, I will present an abstract of what webassembly is the tecnology and capabilities, with multiple examples and demos that could be played directly from the web,

Now that wasm has enabled garbage collector the possibility to use JVM languages has increased, There is a demo to show how to run Kotlin on the browser
