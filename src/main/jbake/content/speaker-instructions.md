## Arrival and stay in Guatemala

We remind you again that the event will take place on **Saturday, August 5**. Our suggestion is that your departure date should be **Monday August 7** as we will have a special event prepared for Sunday the 6th.

## Immediate communication

## Place and parking

The halls have an HDMI projector, electrical connection and in the case of the "main stage" it has audio equipment. There will be an EXCLUSIVE internet connection for speakers, so we ask you not to share the password during the conference.

Each of the rooms will have a JConf volunteer assigned to assist you during room setup and connection. On sponsored talks, they are authorized to give away souvenirs they deem appropriate.

We remind you that the event will take place at the INTECAP ICT CENTER

http://www.guate-jug.net/jconf2023/venue.html

For those who travel by car, the CENTRO TICS Intecap has parking for small cars (sedans) and motorcycles, at a cost of Q10 ($1.10) all day. However, if your entrance is after 9 am, the parking lot will be full, so we suggest you park in the parking lot in front of the Olympic pool, at a cost of Q40 per day ($5).

## Currency and payments

The official currency in Guatemala is the Quetzal, whose exchange rate oscillates between Q 7.6 and Q 7.8 quetzales for one dollar.

Guatemala is one of the countries with the largest credit card management in Central America, it is possible to purchase goods with a card in amounts starting at $4 dollars.

Businesses with POS Bac usually support any card issuer (VISA, Master Card, American Express, Dinners Club), while businesses with VISA usually only support popular cards (VISA, Master Card and American Express).

Additionally, some businesses in the capital accept Bitcoin, but at the moment it is more of a curiosity than a universal mean of payment.

## Public transportation in Guatemala

The capital city has three types of public transport:

- Transmetro - https://rutastransmetro.muniguate.com/
- Transurbano - https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transurbano

Transmetro is considered safe, so you can use it if necessary.

WE DO NOT RECOMMEND for any reason that you take an urban bus, since they are usually uncomfortable and dangerous.

Additionally, Guatemala has four Taxi systems:

* Rotary (white)
* For rent (yellow and green) - http://www.amarilloexpress.com/
* Uber
* Drive

The white taxis only accept cash and usually have very variable charges with foreigners, so we DO NOT RECOMMEND THEM, while the yellow, indrive and uber taxis accept cash and credit cards.

## Safe and unsafe areas of the capital city

Like any event in Latin America, our first suggestion is to take the appropriate precautions to have the best experience during the event.

The capital city is divided into zones, ranging from z1 to z25. The areas considered safe are:

* Zone 4 (where the event will take place)
* Zone 9
* Zone 10
* Zone 13
* Zone 15
* Zone 16

For those interested in sightseeing in the historic center (zone 1), the safest area are the streets surrounding the 6th avenue:

However, our recommendation is not to carry visible valuables and before going somewhere, check with one of the organizers about it.

## Recommended hosting options

The hotel zones with the best options in Guatemala are zones 4, 9, 10, 13 and 15. These are all 15-20 minutes from the event by car.
 
Guatemala has chain hotels such as [Hilton](https://www.hilton.com/es/hotels/guallhh-hilton-guatemala-city/), [Barcel√≥](https://www.barcelo.com/es-ww/barcelo-guatemala-city/), [Marriot](https://www.marriott.com/es/hotels/guawi-the-westin-camino-real-guatemala/overview/), [Ihg](https://www.ihg.com/intercontinental/hotels/us/es/guatemala-city/guaha/hoteldetail) and [Holiday Inn](https://www.ihg.com/holidayinn/hotels/us/es/ciudad-de-guatemala/guact/hoteldetail).
 
Likewise, zone 4 is the bohemian zone of the capital of Guatemala and [one of the best neighborhoods in LATAM](https://hellosafe.com.mx/blog/mejores-barrios-latam). So there are various options nearby on platforms such as Airbnb or Booking.com
